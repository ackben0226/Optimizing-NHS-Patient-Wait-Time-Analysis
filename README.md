## Executive Summary

**Problem:** Chronic NHS 111 wait times drive:

**Patient Risks:** 12% abandonment = 850+ unresolved emergencies daily

**Financial Waste:** ¬£4.8M/year inefficiencies in clinical staff allocation

**KPI Gaps:** 34% of trusts miss 60-second answer targets

**Solution:** 
<br/>Developed an analytical framework identifying:
  1. Priority Regions: North West England (22.9% abandonment)
  2. Cost Levers: 23% clinical time spent on non-urgent calls
  3. Optimization Model: 18% staffing cost reduction while hitting 95% KPIs

Business Impact

Actionable Outcomes:

Dynamic Staffing ToolReduces peak-hour wait times by 31% (6‚Äì9PM)ROI: ¬£4.70 saved per ¬£1 invested

AI Call Routing PilotTargets high-abandonment postcodes (e.g., LU1, NE3)Impact: 1,200+ hours/month reclaimed for emergencies

Technical Approach

Data Pipeline

# Clean 534K+ NHS 111 call records
df = clean_data(raw_data)
df['abandonment_rate'] = df['Abandoned'] / df['Offered']

# Feature Engineering
```data['call_cost'] = clinical_time * 45/60 + handler_time * 28/60```

Predictive Modeling

ARIMA Forecast: 92% accuracy in 7-day call volume predictions

Regression Insights: Ambulance Dispatches = -17.63*(Call Duration) + Œµ (p=0.459, R¬≤=0.001)

Cost Optimization

MILP Model: Minimize staffing costs while meeting 95% KPI targets

Output: Day-parting schedule reducing overtime by 22%

Strategic Recommendations

Phase 1 (0‚Äì3 Months):

Train 200+ handlers on non-clinical call protocols

Pilot dynamic routing in Lincolnshire (¬£3.79 cost/call)

Phase 2 (4‚Äì6 Months):

Deploy predictive staffing model across 5 high-risk trusts

Negotiate cloud hosting for real-time dashboard

Phase 3 (7‚Äì12 Months):

Expand AI routing nationwide

Partner with NHS Digital for API integration

Future Roadmap

Patient Risk Scoring: Prioritize calls by clinical urgency (ML)

Policy Simulation: Model Brexit staffing impacts

Voice Analytics: NLP to detect unresolved issues in ‚Äúresolved‚Äù calls
